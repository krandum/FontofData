# The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
# See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

# You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
# root 'welcome#index'

# Example of regular route:
#	get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

# Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
#	get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

# Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
#	resources :products

# Example resource route with options:
#	resources :products do
#	 member do
#	get 'short'
#	post 'toggle'
#	 end
#
#	 collection do
#	get 'sold'
#	 end
#	end

# Example resource route with sub-resources:
#	resources :products do
#	 resources :comments, :sales
#	 resource :seller
#	end

# Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
#	resources :products do
#	 resources :comments
#	 resources :sales do
#	get 'recent', on: :collection
#	 end
#	end

# Example resource route with concerns:
#	concern :toggleable do
#	 post 'toggle'
#	end
#	resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
#	resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

# Example resource route within a namespace:
#	namespace :admin do
#	 # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
#	 # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
#	 resources :products
#	end
